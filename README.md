KK4VCZ's GoodPSK
================


GoodPSK is a tool for generating PSK31 audio recordings, sometimes
with strange or clever attributes.  Someday it might also decode
traffic or allow for live interactions.

As a poor attempt at literate programming, I'm using this tool to
generate a series of lectures about PSK31 that are broadcast in PSK31!
I will transmit these on a regular schedule in 6 and 10 meters.
